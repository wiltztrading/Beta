# Instruction Manual for MANUAL STAND CONDUIT BENDER

**Brand:** Travaza
**Model:** Beta 25

## Introduction

This manual provides instructions for the safe and effective use of the Manual Stand Conduit Bender. This tool is designed for bending electrical metallic tubing (EMT) and other types of conduit pipes to specific angles.

## Safety Precautions

*   Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), including safety glasses and gloves.
*   Ensure the bender is securely mounted to a stable surface before use.
*   Inspect the bender for any damage or wear before each use. Do not use if damaged.
*   Use only for its intended purpose of bending conduit.
*   Keep fingers and other body parts clear of the bending area.
*   Apply pressure smoothly and evenly. Avoid sudden or jerky movements.
*   Do not exceed the bender's capacity for conduit size or type.

## Components

1.  **Bending Shoe:** The curved part of the bender that shapes the conduit.
2.  **Handle:** Provides leverage for bending.
3.  **Mounting Stand:** Secures the bender to a workbench or other surface.
4.  **Angle Markings:** Indicate the degree of the bend.
5.  **Conduit Retainer:** Holds the conduit in place during bending.

## Operation

1.  **Mount the Bender:** Securely fasten the mounting stand to a stable, level workbench or other surface using bolts or clamps.
2.  **Select the Correct Bender:** Ensure the bender is the correct size for the conduit you are bending.
3.  **Mark the Conduit:** Measure and mark the conduit where the bend is needed.
4.  **Position the Conduit:**
    *   Lift the handle to open the bender.
    *   Place the conduit in the bender, aligning your mark with the appropriate marking on the bender.
    *   Lower the handle to secure the conduit with the retainer.
5.  **Bend the Conduit:**
    *   Grasp the handle firmly with both hands.
    *   Apply steady, even pressure to the handle, pulling it downwards.
    *   Continue pulling until the desired angle is reached, as indicated by the angle markings on the bender.
6.  **Release the Conduit:**
    *   Slowly raise the handle to its original position.
    *   Remove the bent conduit from the bender.
7.  **Verify the Angle:** Use a protractor or angle finder to verify the bend angle.

## Maintenance

*   Keep the bender clean and free of debris.
*   Lubricate moving parts periodically with a light oil.
*   Store in a dry place to prevent rust.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Conduit Kinking:**
    *   Applying pressure too quickly.
    *   Bender is not the correct size for the conduit.
    *   Conduit is not properly secured.
*   **Inaccurate Bends:**
    *   Conduit not aligned correctly with markings.
    *   Not accounting for "spring back" (the tendency of the conduit to slightly unbend after pressure is released). You may need to bend slightly past the desired angle.
